# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Integration with multiple job platforms with varying API structures
- **Mitigation**: Create abstraction layer and standardized adapters for each platform
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize platforms with stable APIs first, then add scraped sources

- **Risk**: Web scraping reliability and maintenance
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling and monitoring
- **Mitigation**: Create fallback mechanisms for when scraping fails
- **Mitigation**: Schedule regular reviews of scraping code to handle site changes

- **Risk**: Performance issues with large volumes of job data
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient caching strategies
- **Mitigation**: Use pagination and lazy loading
- **Mitigation**: Optimize database queries and indexing

## MVP Scoping
- **Risk**: Feature creep extending development timeline
- **Mitigation**: Clearly define MVP with minimal feature set (core platforms, basic search, simple UI)
- **Mitigation**: Create modular architecture to allow incremental feature additions
- **Mitigation**: Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

- **Risk**: Difficulty determining most valuable features for users
- **Mitigation**: Start with essential search and notification capabilities
- **Mitigation**: Implement analytics to track feature usage
- **Mitigation**: Plan for user feedback collection early

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: API rate limits and costs for external services
- **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent caching and request batching
- **Mitigation**: Set up usage monitoring and alerts
- **Mitigation**: Create queuing system for non-urgent requests

- **Risk**: Scaling challenges as user base grows
- **Mitigation**: Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
- **Mitigation**: Implement database sharding strategy
- **Mitigation**: Use cloud services that allow easy scaling
